    Unfortunately, it has been archived on March 1st, 2024 (https://github.com/sadellie/unitto) without any notice or explanation. Since there has been no activity from sadellie on GitHub since then, I guess they are not actively working on projects anymore. I will maintain this app, but I do not plan to add new features. I don't have enough time to do that, but you are welcome to contribute. I will review and merge your pull requests.
