### Code

#### How to build without `google-services.json`
Ideally you need a Firebase project and `google-services.json` in `app` folder. This way you will be able to use all build variants. 

If you don't need all build variants, you can:
1. **Import** this project into Android Studio.
2. **Select** any build variant that has *fdroid* in it's name (e.g. *fdroidDebug*).
3. **Build**. You should see the following in **Build Output**:
   ```
   ...
   > Configure project :app
   Didn't add Google Services since F-Droid flavor was chosen.
   ...
   ```

Open issue in case you need any sort of help. It's free.

*Note: If your contribution is related to Firebase/Google Services, contact me first.*
