Wee-Woo, "Fire engine red" update is here!

1. Calculator. No need to switch between apps, calculate and convert in one-go. Quick note about calculator â€“ it's smart, like really.
2. Settings screen. Added icons and rearranged screen. It's now way easier to customize your experience.
3. Green is now greener. Now using a more saturated green.
4. Some tiny little barely visible UI tweaks.

Thank you for using Unitto!
